# Active Context: KTET Quiz

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on initializing the Memory Bank for the KTET Quiz project. This involves creating the core documentation files to establish a baseline understanding of the project's purpose, technology, and architecture.

## 2. Recent Changes

- The Memory Bank has been created.
- The following files have been generated:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`

## 3. Next Steps

- Create the `progress.md` file to complete the initial Memory Bank setup.
- Once the Memory Bank is initialized, the next step will be to review the existing codebase to understand its current state and identify areas for improvement.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- The initial documentation is based on inferences from the project's file structure. It will need to be verified and updated as the project is explored in more detail.
