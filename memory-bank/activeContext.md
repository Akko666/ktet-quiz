# Active Context: KTET Quiz

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on initializing the Memory Bank for the KTET Quiz project. This involves creating the core documentation files to establish a baseline understanding of the project's purpose, technology, and architecture.

## 2. Recent Changes

- The Memory Bank has been created.
- The following files have been generated:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`

## 3. Next Steps

- Create the `progress.md` file to complete the initial Memory Bank setup.
- Once the Memory Bank is initialized, the next step will be to review the existing codebase to understand its current state and identify areas for improvement.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- The initial documentation is based on inferences from the project's file structure. It will need to be verified and updated as the project is explored in more detail.

## 5. User Reported Issues (2025-10-01)

- The user reports that the deployed website's UI is "collapsed" and non-functional.
- There are deployment issues on Vercel, specifically a warning: "The vercel.json file should exist inside the provided root directory".
- The user wants a thorough investigation and fix for all problems to make the site live.
- The user is also seeing JSON errors in `/home/anil/.gemini/settings.json`, which might be a separate issue related to their local configuration.
